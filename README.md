# Optimizing-the-marketing-campaign
Data analysis project for a marketing promotional campaign using the Python programming language.

We prepared the appropriate libraries and then we imported the data from the kaggle site(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/davinwijaya/customer-retention).

Then we did the data exploration and cleaning work.

We extracted several questions from the data to answer them through the analysis.

After that, we analyzed the data by answering the questions posed.

And we made graphs to see the results more clearly.

Then we extracted the results and interpreted them.
